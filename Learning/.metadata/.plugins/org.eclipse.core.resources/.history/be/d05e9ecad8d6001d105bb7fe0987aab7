	 How Deadlock occurs?
		Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. 
		Deadlock occurs when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in different order. 
		A Java multithreaded program may suffer from the deadlock condition 
		because the synchronized keyword causes the executing thread to block while waiting for the lock, 
		or monitor, associated with the specified object.
